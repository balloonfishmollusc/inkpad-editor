/// This is an extension value that just pulls together a whole lot of
/// extensions that you might want in a basic editor. It is meant as a
/// convenient helper to quickly set up CodeMirror without installing
/// and importing a lot of packages.
///
/// Specifically, it includes...
///
///  - [the default command bindings](#commands.defaultKeymap)
///  - [line numbers](#gutter.lineNumbers)
///  - [special character highlighting](#view.highlightSpecialChars)
///  - [the undo history](#history.history)
///  - [a fold gutter](#fold.foldGutter)
///  - [custom selection drawing](#view.drawSelection)
///  - [multiple selections](#state.EditorState^allowMultipleSelections)
///  - [reindentation on input](#language.indentOnInput)
///  - [the default highlight style](#highlight.defaultHighlightStyle) (as fallback)
///  - [bracket matching](#matchbrackets.bracketMatching)
///  - [bracket closing](#closebrackets.closeBrackets)
///  - [autocompletion](#autocomplete.autocompletion)
///  - [rectangular selection](#rectangular-selection.rectangularSelection)
///  - [active line highlighting](#view.highlightActiveLine)
///  - [active line gutter highlighting](#gutter.highlightActiveLineGutter)
///  - [selection match highlighting](#search.highlightSelectionMatches)
///  - [search](#search.searchKeymap)
///  - [commenting](#comment.commentKeymap)
///  - [linting](#lint.lintKeymap)
///
/// (You'll probably want to add some language package to your setup
/// too.)
///
/// This package does not allow customization. The idea is that, once
/// you decide you want to configure your editor more precisely, you
/// take this package's source (which is just a bunch of imports and
/// an array literal), copy it into your own code, and adjust it as
/// desired.
